  <h1>Hi! My name is Josh Anthony</h1>
  <h2>Last name redacted because I still teach in a public school</h2>
  
  <img src="https://cleananddelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Avocad0-CD.jpg" alt="My last name sounds similar to this fruit." />
  
  <p>I was born and raised in central Jersey. Both of my parents immigrated from the Philippines in the early 90s, and I was born soon afterwards!</p>
  
  <p>Currently I'm living in Plainsboro, NJ, working as a middle school music teacher. Aside from teaching, my passion lies with technology, games, and fostering a sense of community.</p>
